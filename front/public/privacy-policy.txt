BreezyBoard respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the personal information you provide. We collect the information you give us when you create an account, such as name and email address, and we store a securely hashed representation of your password so you can log in. We also collect the content you create in the app, including boards, tasks, checklists, assignments and files. In addition, we record technical and usage information such as IP address, timestamps and basic device or browser information to help operate and secure the service and to understand how people use the app.

We use the information we collect to provide and maintain your account, to display and synchronize your boards and tasks, to send you important account-related messages, and to analyze and improve the app. We do not sell or rent your personal information. We may share data with third-party providers that help operate the service (for example hosting and email providers) and we may disclose information if required by law or to protect rights, property or safety. Where possible we limit the amount of personal data shared and require providers to follow reasonable security practices.

BreezyBoard uses cookies or similar technologies to keep you logged in, remember basic preferences and collect anonymous usage analytics. You can manage cookies through your browser settings, but disabling cookies may affect how the app works. We take reasonable technical and organizational steps to protect your data, but no system is completely secure. If a data breach affecting your personal information occurs, we will follow applicable law and notify affected users as required.

We retain your account data as long as your account is active or as needed to comply with legal obligations. You have the right to access, correct, export or request deletion of your personal data. To exercise these rights or to ask privacy-related questions, contact Kevin at kfeuerschvenger@gmail.com. BreezyBoard is not intended for children under 13; if you believe an account for a child under 13 was created without parental consent, contact us so we can remove the account.

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. When we make material changes we will post an updated version in the app and, where appropriate, notify users by email.
